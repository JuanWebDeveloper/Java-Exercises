# List Of Exercises

In this file you will find the description of all the exercises that I solved in the program.

## `Exercise One`

Declare 2 numeric variables (with the value you want), and indicate which is greater of the two. If they are the same, indicate it as well. Go changing the values to check that it works.

## `Exercise Two`

To the previous exercise, add console entry of two values and indicate if they are greater, lesser or equal.
